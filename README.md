# Energy Demand Forecasting (AEP Dataset)

This project analyzes and forecasts hourly electricity demand using the American Electric Power (AEP) dataset. The goal is to model long-term energy consumption patterns and build a predictive model with improved accuracy using machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Hourly Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption)
- Region: AEP (likely Ohio, USA)
- Time range: 2004 to 2018
- Granularity: Hourly

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data cleaning and exploration
2. Trend analysis and seasonal decomposition
3. Baseline statistical models (Naive, Moving Average)
4. Advanced model: XGBoost Regressor
5. Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE

## 📈 Results
- Best model: XGBoost  
- MAE: 456.19  
- RMSE: 607.10

## 🔧 Future Work
- Integrate external temperature/weather data
- Add holiday indicators
- Use deep learning (LSTM, TCN) for further improvement
